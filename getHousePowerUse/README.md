Misty II Displays Home Power Meter Info

In this skill, Misty checks total house power consumption from a local network connected power meter, and if it is above a user determined threshold, will display RED led. If it is lower than lower threshold will display GREEN. If in between two thresholds, will display YELLOW. 

Misty's left arm will show the power level, with fully up indicating high usage, and fully down indicating low usage. With a glance at Misty, will be able to tell the house present power consumption. (And hopefully turn off some lights.)
